# timelapsed-cam-pics

This is an experimental application to capture photos from a webcam to make possible to create a time lapsed movie.


To try it, just run it: `python3 timelapsed-cam-pics.py` and it'll take a photo of your default webcam every 30 seconds for one hour.

By the way, I suggest to use [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) for running it without changing your system configuration.

## TODOs

[ ] Write some PEP documentation
[ ] Add metadata into the pictures
[ ] Allow to configure the time between the photos (now it's 30 seconds)
[ ] Allow to configure the time the application must run (now it's for one hour)
[ ] Create installation configuration (write a setup.py to be used with PyPI)
