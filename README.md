# timelapsed-cam-pics

This is a experimental application to capture photos from a webcam to make possible to create an time lapsed movie.

To try it, just run it: `python3 timelapsed-cam-pics.py`

By the way, I suggest to use [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) for running it without changing your system configuration.
