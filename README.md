# timelapsed-cam-pics

This is an experimental application to capture photos from a webcam to make possible to create a time lapsed movie.

To try it, just run it: `python3 timelapsed-cam-pics.py` and it'll take a photo of your default webcam every 30 seconds for one hour.

By the way, I suggest to use [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) for running it without changing your system configuration.
